## About Me

Hi, I'm Sergio Gao, right now an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science, in Hangzhou Dianzi University.

I'm going to attend the ICPC or CCPC for the coming 1 or 2 years, 
which allows us to print the material for our algorithm templates in advance.
So I build such a project, basically powered by $\LaTeX$.

My main training website is CodeForces. Here is [my profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/gsj_z).

## About the Project

The main file to print is `XCPC_Template/main.pdf`. At the same time, you can find all the original `.tex` `.cpp` files.

As I'm still training for the competition, the project is updating. I'll gradually edit it to fit my personal requirements.

I'll add more XCPC-related contents in the future. To name a few, I may produce a few slides for teaching; I may turn to create some original problems after I reach my goals; I may share some tutorials which deserves.
